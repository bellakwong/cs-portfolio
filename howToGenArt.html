        <h1>Generative Art How To</h1>
        <img src="Photos/GAfishNew.gif" width="400px">
        <p>For my Generative Art project, I made a program that makes fish 
        appear when you click in the ocean. It uses different types of Javascript 
        functions, loops, and conditionals. This webpage will show you how I coded it.
        </p>

            <!-- THE OCEAN -->
            <h2><u>The Ocean</u></h2>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">In order to make the ocean, I used a for loop in the draw function.
            The draw function looks like <code>draw = function(){</code>. Anything in 
            it will constantly redraw itself over and over again every frame. Inside it,
            I used a 'for loop', which looks like <code>for (var</code>... I used this 
            because the ocean is actaully a blue rectangle. The loop is a chain of 
            light blue circles that are constanly moving to the right. I could have coded a 
            set of indivisual circles to constantly move to the right, but a loop is more efficient.</p>
            
            <p style="text-indent: 40px"><code>for (var i = 0; i < width; i += 80)</code> controls where on the 
            y-axis the ovals are. The first part, <code>var i = 0;</code>, is executed before the loop 
            begins. The second statement, <code> i < width</code>, is the condition for running the 
            third statement. So in order for <code>i += 80</code>, the variable <code>i</code> 
            has to be less than the width. The last statement is executed everytime after the loop, as 
            in the code under/inside it was executed. For example, after line 24, the loop will start from 
            <code>for (var j = startPlace; j < height; j += 80){</code>. This controls where
            on the x-axis the ovals move. The computer runs this since <code>j</code> 
            controls the y-axis. The code underneath it specifically draws the 
            shape (<code>ellipse</code>) and colors is (<code>fill</code>). The code 
            <code>noStroke();</code> is needed because without it, it looks like this:
            <br><img src="Photos/noStroke.png" width="280px"></p>
            
            <p style="text-indent: 40px"><code>startPlace++</code> is an increment of my variable <code>startPlace</code>.
            This is what makes the "waves" actually move.
            The code below...
            <code>
            <br>
            if (startPlace >= -300){</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">startPlace = -600;
            <br>}
            </code>
            <br>...programs the ovals so that when they go past a certain point (-300px), the chain will 
            move back to the left to its orignal starting point off screen (-600px).
            </p>

        <!-- THE FISH -->
        <div class="leftSide">
            <h2><u>The Fish</u></h2>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">As you can see, the code for the fish is in a function I made called 
            <code>drawFish = function(x, y){</code>. This was programmed in this function 
            because when <code>drawFish</code> is called, then the computer will run  
            the code and the fish will appear. <code>(x, y)</code> is there so that the 
            fish is drawn where the mouse is.
            <br>Of the code shown on the right, line 47 to 55 are used to make the fish. 
            Line 45 to 53 make up the fishes' bodies. Line 54 and 55 program the fish eye.

        <!-- ON CLICK -->
        <div class="leftSide">
            <h2><u>Click for Fish</u></h2>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">In order to make the fish show up when it was clicked, I coded this array,
            <code>fishStay</code>. This was above the draw function. You can see it in the first image 
            to the right. Without this array, the background will constantly draw itself over the fish and the 
            fish will appear to be flashing. This is also why the variable is called "fishStay."</p>
            
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">The second right photo shows the for loop made for it. 
            <code> k = 0;</code> is initiated before the loop starts. Once <code>k < fishStay.length</code>
            is true, then <code>k</code> will increment by 1 every time the loop is repeated (<code>k++</code>).

        <!-- RESTRICTION IN THE SKY -->
        <div class="leftSide">
            <h2><u>Not in the Sky</u></h2>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">This block of code shown on the right is a conditional, or an 
            if statement. I programmed this so that when you click above 300px on the y-axis, a 
            fish will not be drawn. I did this by using <code>mouseY</code>, which uses the y-axis from 
            the mouse. The code <code>fishStay.push({x:mouseX + 130, y:mouseY - 50});</code> makes it so 
            that when the mouse is clicked (<code>.push</code>), a fish is drawn. The numbers 130 and -50 
            make the fish appear exactly where the mouse cursor is. Without it, it looks like the gif 
            to the right.

        <h2><u>Reflection</u></h2>
            <h3>Choices</h3>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">
               I had to decide how to make the ocean look like waves. I thought of 
               how ovals could easily make it look right, so I make loop of them that 
               traveled down the screen.
            </p>
            <h3>What I Will Remember</h3>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">
                I will remember how to make a loop of shapes move in a ceratin direction. 
                I will remember because I helped other people animate their projects to 
                move horizontally across the screen. I had practice from animating snow 
                fall in another project. This time, I got help and figured how to make 
                the shapes move to the right rather than down.
            </p>
            <h3>If I Had More Time</h3>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">
                If I had more time I would make the fish turn different colors and 
                make it so that the fish disappear and the game resets.
